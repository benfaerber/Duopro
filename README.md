# Duopro
A Javascript user script, that adds some extra functionality to Duolingo.

Add this as new script to your favorite Javascript injection extenstion.
I use GreaseMonkey for Firefox and I have only tested it in Firefox.

This adds a control panel allowing you to hide golden skills and a dark theme.
